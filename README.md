# Unlocking-Online-Shopper-Behavior

**Problem:**
There are many visitors on the e-commerce company website, but only a few visitors make purchases. Only 16% of visitors make a purchase, while the remaining 84% only visit the e-commerce web page. Therefore, we need to understand the factors that influence the visitor's purchasing decision.

**Goal:**
Increase the conversion rate of e-commerce visitors.

**Objective:**
1. Increase the visitor conversion rate and revenue of e-commerce companies through the creation of predictive models that can predict whether a visitor will make a purchase or not.
2. Creating a customer segmentation model based on the behavior of a visitor's duration in visiting a page. 
3. Identify and understand user behavior that has the most influence on revenue generation decisions, and provide data-based recommendations to increase conversions. 

**Business Metrics:**
Conversion Rate -> The percentage of visitors who will eventually make a purchase or not.
