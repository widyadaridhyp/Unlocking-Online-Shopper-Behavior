# Optimizing Customer Conversion Rates in E-Commerce

**Problem:**
Customers who successfully converted from all people who visited the company website were 15.5%, with an average conversion of 14.45 per month. Shop Ease as one of the e-commerce platforms still wants to maintain and improve this conversion rate. However, the company still does not have a deep understanding of the factors that affect customer conversion. Without an understanding of conversions and predictive tools, the company risks missing opportunities to optimize marketing strategies and facing a potential decline in customer conversions.

**Goal:**
1. Identify factors that affect customer conversion
2. Increase company sales
3. Anticipate further decline in sales
